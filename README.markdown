Ruby + Upskirt = Markdown that doesn't suck
===========================================

Redcarpet is a Ruby wrapper for Upskirt. It is mostly based on Ryan
Tomayko's RDiscount wrapper, and inspired by Rick Astley wearing a kilt.

Redcarpet is powered by the Upskirt library, which can be found at

	https://www.github.com/tanoku/upskirt

bindings so awesome.

Install
-------

Redcarpet is readily available as a Ruby gem:

    $ [sudo] gem install redcarpet

The Redcarpet source (including Upskirt as a submodule) is available at GitHub:

    $ git clone git://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet.git

Usage
-----

Redcarpet implements the basic protocol popularized by RedCloth:

~~~~~~ {ruby}
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
~~~~~~

[Additional processing options](http://rdoc.info/github/tanoku/redcarpet/master/Redcarpet#autolink-instance_method) can be turned on when creating the
Redcarpet object:

~~~~~~ {ruby}
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!", :smart, :filter_html)
~~~~~~

Note that by default, Redcarpet parses standard Markdown (with no extensions)
and offers a sane subset of parse options which allow you to modify the rendering
output and to enable MD extensions on a per-case basis.

Redcarpet also offers a wrapper class, `RedcarpetCompat` with the same flags
and behavior as the RDiscount library, which acts as a drop-in replacement.
